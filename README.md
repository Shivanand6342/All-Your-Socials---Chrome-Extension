# All-Your-Socials---Chrome-Extention
- All Your Socials is a Chrome Extention made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript(not currently in use, but for Future updates), JSON file.
- It will show and led up to your all social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Github, CodePen, Instagram, etc.
- This is the first version of my Extention, hence all the data here are static.
- For now, I have displayed these social medias,
  * Website / Portfolio
  * LinkedIn
  * Github
  * CodePen
  * Instagram
  * Facebook
  * Twitter
- This will help you to quickly access to your social media pages.
